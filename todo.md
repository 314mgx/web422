Test scheduling... sometime during the timeslot vs. at the start (as stated on the **weekly-schedule** page)  

DB3078 computer configuration - versions of runtimes and editors  

On the **weekly-schedule** page, remove the bullets most columns

On the **notes** page, will need another two columns when we start adding graded work

Also, maybe remove bullets, so we can have clean markdown

Nav menu, responsive

Maybe Bootstrap styling

Text color... should be darker (existing is #606c71, grey, does not yield enough contrast, should be black)  
Its value is set in variables.scss
