Test scheduling... sometime during the timeslot vs. at the start (as stated on the **weekly-schedule** page)  

DB3078 computer configuration - versions of runtimes and editors  

On the **weekly-schedule** page, remove the bullets most columns

On the **notes** page, will need another two columns when we start adding graded work

Also, maybe remove bullets, so we can have clean markdown

Nav menu, responsive

Maybe Bootstrap styling

Text color... should be darker (existing is #606c71, grey, does not yield enough contrast, should be black)  
Its value is set in variables.scss

### Grading

As discussed on Thu Sep 21... 

First two assigns, teacher grades every one.  
We use a rubric, online or paper.  
For all other assigns, student will use a rubric to assess their own work.  
We grade a randomly-selected fraction of assigns  
Then we compare the average of the self-asssessed work to the average of the work we assess (with? without? the values of the randomly-selected fraction of assigns that we grade).  
We multiply the self-assessed grade value by the averages delta.  

The idea is that this promotes some honesty.  
And some adjustment for reality.  

We ought to do the numbers to assure that we do actually grade each student's work another two or three times in the term.  
Randomness should help prevent a student from predicting when their work will be looked at, which can modify their behaviour on a specific piece of work (initial quality, self-assessed grade, etc.).  

The rubric can be distributed (made available) just after the assignment is due.  
Maybe the rubric is a Blackboard "test", multiple choice:  
1. Complete
2. Partial
3. Not done

Column organization, assignment post and upload, not in gradebook calculation or shown to students.  
Rubric maybe not in gradebook calculation, but we do create a computed column using the averages delta.  
Let's try to have the Blackboard system help us out as much as possible.  
Also, see if we can get it into a form where we can "export" some of this for easy import into other sections of a course, repeatedly, per term. 

A student can self-assess.  
Or they can trade off with a friend.  
Either way, the honesty factor should still happen.  

Peter will attempt to work with Kevin Pitts during the early fall to see what Blackboard can help with.  
Also, put this proposal before other programming teachers.
