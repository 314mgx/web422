* [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML) Guide, including [HTML Forms Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Forms), and the [HTML5 Element List](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5/HTML5_element_list)
* [CSS Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)

Oh, and you should must know (and love!) the series of RFCs that describe HTTP, [7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230) through 7235. If you want a friendlier introduction to [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol), read its Wikipedia article.
