### Previous courses

This is the third course in the web programming sequence. 

Therefore, continue to use the content from the courses that you have successfully completed:

WEB222 - Web Programming Principles

WEB322 - Web Programming Tools and Frameworks

<br>

### Developer tools

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  
Browsers (current versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, Edge)  
Browser dev tools  
HTTP inspector (e.g. [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/))  

You will need one or more devices. A College or personal desktop or laptop, and (likely) a personal mobile device (e.g. a smartphone).

Other editors...


[Plunker](https://plnkr.co/)

JSFiddle, JS Bin

FYI - The Monaco Editor is the code editor that powers VS Code. [Info page is here.](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/index.html)  

<br>

### Required textbook

None. 

This is a web programming course. Therefore, the best source for content is on the web!

<br>

### Required online resources

There are several required online resources:

The **Mozilla Developer Network** (MDN) is vast, with thousands of documents. It is a trusted and authoritative source for web developer information. Of interest:

* [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML) Guide, including [HTML Forms Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Forms), and the [HTML5 Element List](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5/HTML5_element_list)
* [CSS Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
* [JavaScript Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
* [DOM Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM)

Official [Angular Documentation](https://angular.io/docs)

Angular CLI videos on YouTube, by [Codevolution](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC80PWRj_ZU8Zu0HSMNVwKWw/videos)

JavaScript:  
MDN, and...  
[You Don't Know JavaScript](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) book series, free; looks pretty good

Node.js and Express.js:  
[nodejitsu](https://docs.nodejitsu.com/) - looks pretty good

Oh, and you should must know (and love!) the series of RFCs that describe HTTP, [7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230) through 7235. If you want a friendlier introduction to [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol), read its Wikipedia article.

<br>

### Other resources

[W3C Standards](https://www.w3.org/standards/) - a very good resource
