## Adding Sorting & Paging

Using the methods outlined in the lodash documentation (TODO: Link to course notes), we can very easily add "paging" and "sorting" functionality to our week1 **web-api-v6** example.  This can be accomplished using the **.\_template()**, **.\_chunk()**, **.\_take()** and **.\_sortBy()** methods.
