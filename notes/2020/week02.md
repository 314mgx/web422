## WEB422 Week 2 Notes

The theme for the next week or more is to continue to expand upon our client-side, browser-based development skills, using long-established libraries such as Lodash and Moment.js.

We will also be introducing at SASS as a powerful and widely adopted CSS preprocessor / extension language (likely during the Lab period).

**Topics:**

Helpful Utility Functions with [Lodash](lodash.md)

Leveraging [Lodash Templates to render data](lodash-render.md)

Handling Date/Time information using [Moment.js](moment.md)

[Introduction to SASS](sass.md)
