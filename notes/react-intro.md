## Introduction to React

Our last topic stop before we get to Angular is **React**. We will plan to work with React this week and next.

React is a widely-used JavaScript library for building user interfaces. In terms of mindshare for front-end development, React and Angular have almost all of it. 

For us, React will be very useful, as a way to introduce *component*-oriented architecture when developing apps.

### Relevant history

It all starts with Facebook, which is a web app that has worldwide reach, and about two *billion* users, according to Facebook and [other metrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_virtual_communities_with_more_than_100_million_active_users). 

At scale, the app that the user interacts with must offer good-enough performance, and worthwhile features and functionality. React is the front-end engine for these, on both browser and mobile device platforms.
