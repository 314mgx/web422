## WEB422 Week 7 Notes

Recall, the theme for the *remainder of the course* is to cover the Angular platform.  

Since week 6 was spent with a quick introduction of the angular workflow (ie, bootstrapping an Angular app using "ng new", running the app with "ng serve" editing classes using typescript, etc), we can now focus our attention specifically on **components**, and how we can construct a view in Angular using components.

To get started, we will first do a quick review on how to create a new Angular project from scratch.  We will then focus on:

* Discussing what exactly an Angular component is, at a high level
* Creating components manually / using the Angular CLI
* How to think about, and plan your components (this is similar to the thinking introduced in the "React" coverage)
* An introduction to using "templates" in components
* A brief discussion on attribute &amp; structural directives.

The detailed notes for the above topics can be found on:

* The ["Angular Components Introduction"](angular-components-intro) page: Here we discuss Components in detail, including how to get started using components / creating components from scratch, using "templates" in components, and writing attribute/structural directive.

* The ["Angular Components Example"](angular-components-example) page: Here, we walk through a simple example of planning a view with multiple components from scratch.

Once we are comftorable working with components, we can continue progressing through Angular in the following weeks.  This will include topics such as, routing, services, forms, etc.
