## WEB422 Week 4 Notes

Ideas: Compose a page with components and continue to use Bootstrap 3 CSS as usual, by importing the CDN into index.html .... but we can also use Bootstrap 3 components by installing: 

npm install react-bootstrap@0.33.1

and using components:  https://react-bootstrap-v3.netlify.com/components/

we can reference them using the syntax:

import { DropdownButton, MenuItem } from 'react-bootstrap';


we can also talk about routing here..



then week 5, we can talk about connecting our "Sales" api and working with forms
