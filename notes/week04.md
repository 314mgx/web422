## WEB422 Week 4 Notes

This week we will continue to work with **React**.  We will continue to work with *props* as a way to communicate data between components, as well as introduce event handling and working with data from an API.  This will include wiring up a "fetch" request when a component is mounted, storing the result in "state" and rendering the data in a table / list, and displaying content (or not) while we're waiting for data to load.  

Next, we will focus on how we can achieve routing within the browser by leveraging the excellent [react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom) components.  This will allow uses to quickly navigate to different "views" without leaving the application.

Finally, we will put this all together and make a simple app that uses 3rd party UI components ([react-bootstrap - version 0.33.1](https://react-bootstrap-v3.netlify.com/) and [react-router-bootstrap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-bootstrap)) to create a simple UI to view data from the public [reqres testing API](https://reqres.in/).
