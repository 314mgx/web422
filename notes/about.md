## About these notes

The notes are organized into weekly blocks.

During the course, there will be a number of topic *themes*, or major areas of study. Each theme will take a week or more to cover. 

In any theme, there will be a number of *topics*. The amount of time we need to cover a topic will vary - some will take minutes, while others will take hours. 

Here's how the topic notes are presented:

**Notes page for a specific week**

Each week has its own page (e.g. week01, week02, etc.). 

This page will state the *theme*, and have content that will discuss and link to separate *topic* pages.

The idea is that a specific topic page can be used as a module, which can be moved around or replaced in future versions of the course. The editing task will hopefully be easier too.
