## WEB422 Week 6 to 7 Notes

The theme for the next week or more is to work with Angular (components/routing). This is one of a small number of important Angular topics that must be mastered early in your learning process.

Remember to frequently use the [learning resources](/web422/resources).

**Topics:**

Components, deep dive, lots of coverage, typical use cases

> Not sure whether "Components" should be covered first in a deep dive, or "Routing"
> 
> The idea is that the following week builds upon (re-uses) the content from the previous weeks
