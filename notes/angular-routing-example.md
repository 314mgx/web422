Your professors believe that it is important to plan your work *before writing code*. How?

A simple diagram will help you identify the information and functionality that your app needs. It will also naturally suggest what components it will need. *It will also naturally suggest how routing will work in the app.* 

> Do this *BEFORE WRITING CODE*. 

For our example app, here's what we're trying to do. Each rectangle will (or could) have information and/or functionality inside.

### Generate a new project
