In this document, you will create an app with several components. 

The goal is to become comfortable with the idea of components, and the process of creating and displaying them.

### Getting started, new project

Visualize  
Draw a quick diagram  

Gen a new project  
WITH routing! (even though we will not configure routing until next week; adding routing when a new project is created is a best practice)  

Create structural components:
* Header
* Navigation (named "navmain")
* Content
* Footer

Create components to hold content; we'll use an *animals* theme:
* Home (a home or start page)
* Horse
* Lizard
* Bear
* Eagle
* Dolphin
