## WEB422 Week 8 Notes

Recall, the theme for the *remainder of the course* is to cover the Angular platform.  

To get started, we will do a short review of Angular Components from last week,including details surrounding data template structure, binding and directives.  We will then focus on showing how Components interact and share information, as well as go into further information about Component Lifecycle hooks.

Next, we will turn our attention to Routing in Angular, specifically: 

* Examining the supporting documentation on Angular Routing
* How to configure / use Routing
* Adding Routing to an existing application
* Planning Components / Routes
* Configuring Special components / Routes (ie: "Page not Found").

The detailed notes for the above topics can be found in:

* ["Angular Components Continued"](angular-components-contd): (TODO)

* ["Angular Routing Introduction"](angular-routing-intro): (TODO)
