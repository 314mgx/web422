## WEB422 Week 8 Notes

Recall, the theme for the *remainder of the course* is to cover the Angular platform.  

To get started, we will do a short review of Angular Components from last week,including details surrounding data template structure, binding and directives.  We will then focus on showing how Components interact and share information, as well as go into further information about Component Lifecycle hooks.

Next, we will turn our attention to Routing in Angular, specifically: 

* Examining the supporting documentation on Angular Routing
* How to configure / use Routing
* Adding Routing to an existing application
* Planning Components / Routes
* Configuring Special components / Routes (ie: "Page not Found").

The detailed notes for the above topics can be found in:

* ["Angular Components Continued"](angular-components-contd): This document contains the review topics for Angular Components including:
  * Creating Components Using the Angular CLI
  * Structure of an Angular Component
  * Component / Template Data Binding
  * Lifecycle Methods
  * Component Interaction
  * Angular Directives (Structural / Attribute)

* ["Angular Routing Introduction"](angular-routing-intro): This document contains all of the content related to our Angular routing introduction (the main topic covered this week).  It also includes links to additional information in separate documents including:
  * [The official Angular.io documentation](https://angular.io/docs) - ie: the [RouterOutlet documentation](https://angular.io/api/router/RouterOutlet) / [RouterLink documentation](https://angular.io/api/router/RouterLink)
  * [Adding Routing to an existing app](angular-routing-existing-app)
