## WEB422 Week 9 Notes

The theme for this week is to work with Angular forms. An app that interacts with users must use forms efficiently and effectively.  To this end, we focus on:

* Refreshing your memory by showing a simple and standard HTML Form.
* Followed by configuring an Angular app to use HTML forms

We will then discuss how to “bind”  data (using “two-way” binding) and “submit” the form

Finally, we will illustrate some of the special CSS classes Angular uses to automatically track the “state” of elements, ie: “untouched”, “dirty”, “invalid”, etc, followed by a quick discussion on Form Validation in Angular
