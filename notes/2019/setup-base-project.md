## Setup the base project

Sketch out (or describe) the goal:
* A template (also known as a starter project, or a sample project, or a project skeleton, or similar terminology)
* When used, it will create a fully-working and ready-to-use (and deploy) project
* Can use it for a web app
* Or for a web service (which is what we want)
