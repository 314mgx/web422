## Angular forms introduction

> This document is being edited.  
> This notice will be removed when the edits are complete.  

In recent weeks, we have had a straight-line topic treatment of components, routing, and services. However, we have mostly avoided the topic of *user interaction*, but now it's time to do that, now that we have a good foundation on which to build.

### TBA

Start with the first topic in FUNDAMENTALS > Forms  
That is "User Input"  
Skip/ignore the $event binding, as I see no value in showing the wrong way of doing this  
Then move on to "Forms"  

[Here...](https://angular.io/guide/forms#create-the-hero-model-class) it shows the constructor as the place to declare public properties  
OK, this is different from what I understood about TypeScript classes
