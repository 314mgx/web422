## WEB422 Week 1 to 2 Notes

The theme for the first week or more is to transition your success in the previous course to the new topics in this course.

Remember to frequently use the [learning resources](/web422/resources).

**Topics:**

Transition from 322 coverage, that focused on:
* Most of the work was done on the server
* Resources were generated and delivered to browsers
* Very little work with the DOM

Intro to front end dev concepts:
* Study a continuum of needs...
* Static delivery
* Content with a small amount of interaction (dynamic *web page*)
* Application, feature-rich (modern-day Angular and React, "SPA")

Dev environment setup, basic, including back end with a data-rich project  
Create a reusable project to work with during the course

More about web services, adding them to the back end app
* Transition from server-generated HTML pages
* Use all their work and knowledge from the level 3 course
* Code endpoints (resources) for typical GET and POST operations
* Adding web client app features incrementally

(intro blurb here)

We'll be jumping around a bit. No straight line or step-by-step recipe. Some overlap, some repetition (but that's OK for connecting the topics together).
